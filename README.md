# Encillomiae
This is a project I'm working on since now for almost a year. It's a retro-RPG style game. I'm almost the only one to work on Encillomiae. I'm making all the code (in Python-Pygame), all the storylines and all the songs. One of my friends is making sprites and graphical effects. This is an early version of the game, this is not representative of the final project.
